# Mali-Connect: Project Briefing & Vision Document

**Project:** **Mali-Connect**  
**Hackathon Theme:** CHAI Hackathon - Connecting Humans to AI  
**Submission Deadline:** Saturday  
**Team:** Phantomojo (Cybersecurity Expert + Full-Stack Developer)

## 1. The Vision (The "What If?")

What if you could determine the true value of any physical asset with just a smartphone? We are starting with Africa's most important one: **livestock**.

## 2. The Elevator Pitch (The Core Story)

> *"What if you could determine the value of any physical asset with just your phone? We're starting with Africa's most important one: livestock. **Mali-Connect** is an AI platform that transforms a few simple photos into a 'holographic' 3D model of an animal, complete with a full health and value assessment—we call it the 'Mali-Score'. This score becomes a universal certificate for fair trade, insurance, and credit, empowering herders to build climate-resilient wealth."*

## 3. The Problem We Solve

Pastoralist herders' wealth is invisible to the formal economy. Their livestock—their primary asset—cannot be easily verified, valued, or insured. This leads to:

- **Exploitation by middlemen** offering low prices due to information asymmetry
- **Exclusion from financial services** like loans and insurance
- **High vulnerability to climate shocks** like drought and disease
- **Distance to markets** - herders travel 100+ km to sell animals
- **Lack of standardized assessment** - no reliable way to determine livestock value

### The Scale of the Problem
- Pastoralists supply **50% of Kenya's meat and milk**
- Only **~50% of livestock traders** have timely market information
- **Only 12% of African trade** is intra-continental due to opaque supply chains
- **Marsabit County** (larger than many countries) has only one research station

## 4. Our Solution: The "Holographic" Assessment

Mali-Connect is a single-page web application that provides a powerful demo of our core technology:

- **Input:** A user selects a "case file" of 4-6 photos of a specific animal
- **The Magic:** The platform simulates an AI analysis and generates an interactive, 3D "digital twin" of the animal
- **The Output:** The 3D model is overlaid with diagnostic markers pointing to key health indicators. This generates the **"Mali-Score"**

### Technical Innovation
- **3D Holographic Visualization:** World's first 3D livestock assessment platform
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Computer vision and machine learning algorithms
- **Mobile-First Design:** Works on basic smartphones with 2G networks
- **Offline Capability:** Core functionality without internet connection

## 5. The "Mali-Score": Our Key AI Metric

The Mali-Score is a composite score (out of 100) that represents the animal's overall value. It is calculated from four AI-assessed metrics:

- **Body Condition (40%):** How healthy is its weight? (rib visibility, muscle tone)
- **Physical Health (25%):** Is its skin/coat healthy? (coat quality, skin condition)
- **Conformation (20%):** Is its structure sound? (leg structure, posture)
- **Age Estimation (15%):** Is it at a prime age? (facial features, dental condition)

### Market Value Calculation
```
Base Price = $500 (average cattle price in Kenya)
Mali-Score = 88/100
Live Market Value = Base Price × (Mali-Score / 100) × Market Demand Multiplier
$500 × 0.88 × 1.1 = $484
```

## 6. The Ecosystem (The "So What?")

The demo will show how the Mali-Score unlocks a wider ecosystem by presenting three (mock) calls-to-action:

- **List on Marketplace:** With an estimated "Live Market Value" calculated from the score
- **Apply for Insurance:** Using the score as a verifiable health certificate
- **Use as Collateral:** For micro-loans and credit facilities

### Additional Ecosystem Features
- **Resource Management Map:** 3D globe showing vegetation data and market locations
- **Price Variations:** Different market values based on location and demand
- **Climate Resilience:** Tools for building wealth through technology

## 7. Tech Stack & Architecture (For the Devs)

- **Type:** Single-Page Demo Application (Frontend only)
- **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Graphics:** Three.js via `react-three-fiber` and `drei`
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **AI Simulation:** Logic will be hardcoded in a JavaScript/TypeScript object on the frontend. No live backend
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify for easy access

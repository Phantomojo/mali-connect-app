# Mali-Connect: 3D Holographic Livestock Assessment Platform

## üéØ Project Overview

**Vision:** Transform livestock assessment in Africa through AI-powered 3D holographic analysis, creating a universal "Mali-Score" that enables fair trade, insurance, and credit for pastoralists.

**Elevator Pitch:** *"What if you could determine the value of any physical asset with just your phone? We're starting with Africa's most important one: livestock. Mali-Connect is an AI platform that transforms a few simple photos into a 'holographic' 3D model of an animal, complete with a full health and value assessment‚Äîwe call it the 'Mali-Score'. This score becomes a universal certificate for fair trade, insurance, and credit, empowering herders to build climate-resilient wealth."*

```

## üìä Mali-Score Assessment System

### Scoring Algorithm
The AI assessment is based on four key metrics with weighted importance:

```typescript
interface MaliScore {
  bodyCondition: number;    // 40% weight - ribs/bones visibility
  physicalHealth: number;   // 25% weight - skin/coat condition  
  conformation: number;     // 20% weight - structural soundness
  ageEstimation: number;    // 15% weight - facial/dental features
  totalScore: number;       // Weighted composite score (0-100)
}
```

### Market Value Calculation
```typescript
const calculateMarketValue = (maliScore: number, basePrice: number = 500) => {
  const marketDemandMultiplier = 1.1; // Hardcoded for demo
  return basePrice * (maliScore / 100) * marketDemandMultiplier;
};
```

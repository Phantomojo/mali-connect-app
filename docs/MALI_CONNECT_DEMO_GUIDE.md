# Mali-Connect: Demo Presentation Guide

## 🎯 Demo Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Showcase the 3D holographic livestock assessment technology and its potential to transform pastoralist livelihoods in Africa.

**Key Message:** "Mali-Connect transforms simple photos into comprehensive livestock assessments, creating a universal 'Mali-Score' that enables fair trade, insurance, and credit for pastoralists."

## 🎬 Demo Script (7 minutes total)

### 1. Hook & Problem (1.5 minutes)

**Opening Statement:**
*"What if you could determine the value of any physical asset with just your phone? We're starting with Africa's most important one: livestock."*

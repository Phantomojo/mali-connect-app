Data Fragmentation & Supply Chain
Transparency
A freight truck on an African highway illustrates how disconnected networks and paper
trails slow goods movement. Across many African markets, logistics data are
fragmented in silos (e.g. paper manifests, isolated Excel ledgers, unlinked ICT
systems), obscuring visibility from source to destination. For example, Nigeria’s 2023
Logistics Performance Index (LPI) score was only 2.6/5 (rank 88/139), reflecting
severe gaps in customs, tracking, and infrastructure. These inefficiencies inflate
supply chain costs by up to 30% and contribute to excessive delays (only ~15% of
Nigerian roads are paved, causing port dwell times up to 20 days vs ~4 days in
benchmark countries). Digital adoption is low: just ~12% of sub‐Saharan logistics
firms use digital platforms (vs ~68% in Southeast Asia), and interoperability between

government and industry systems is nearly nonexistent. As a result, actors often lack
real-time tracking, cannot flag misroutes or theft, and struggle to forecast delays. The
pain is felt across sectors (e.g. pharmaceuticals expire in transit, agri-food spoilage,
counterfeiting of high-value goods).
• Concrete examples: Up to half of delivery effort is last-mile (as explained

below), but even first-mile and mid-mile suffer from missing handoffs. In
practice, a shipment might have a barcode scanned only at entry and exit
points, leaving multiday gaps with no records.
• Scale of impact: Estimates suggest resolving data gaps could boost intra-

African trade significantly; for instance, only ~12% of African trade is intracontinental, in part due to opaque cross-border flows.
• Solution scope: Viable prototypes include interoperable data dashboards and

basic e-manifests. For example, a minimum‐viable system could combine GPS
trackers on trucks with a mobile/web dashboard that updates location, status,
and scanned receipts at each checkpoint. Startups like Sokowatch and Twiga
Foods show similar ideas: Sokowatch’s mobile/SMS ordering links retailers
and suppliers, giving instant stock visibility; Twiga’s offline-capable mobile
platform streamlines farmer-to-retailer flows and payments.

Pastoralist communities and livestock-dependent
households
Pastoralist herders in Kenya and neighboring countries are the backbone of national
livestock production. They supply roughly half of Kenya’s meat and milk, supporting
livelihoods of millions, yet remain chronically poor. Harsh realities – frequent droughts,
degraded rangelands and water scarcity – compound social challenges. Even though
livestock account for ~50% of Kenya’s agricultural GDP, infrastructure and market
systems for pastoralists are weak. For example, a planned abattoir in Isiolo (intended
for 474,000 animals a year) remains unusable, and many remote herders rely on
itinerant traders or “middlemen” who offer low prices. Only about half of livestock
traders in northern counties have timely market information. Extension and veterinary
services barely reach these areas: Marsabit County (larger than many countries) has

only one research station and one farmer training center for its entire vast ASAL
territory. In practice, pastoralists often travel 100+ km to sell a few animals, incurring
major risks and costs. Financing is scarce: traditional banks shy away from nomadic
herders, and climate shocks wipe out savings. Meanwhile, land fragmentation and
conflict (over pasture and water) further undermine herd management.
Existing Support and Opportunity Areas: There are some NGOs and government
programs (e.g. index-based livestock insurance pilots, community grazing bylaws, and
livestock market platforms) but coverage is limited. Current extension reaches few
herders, and most financing comes from informal rotating savings groups.
Infrastructure projects (roads, water pans, abattoirs) often stall or under-serve pastoral
zones. Opportunity areas for innovation include:
• Market linkages: New networks or platforms (mobile or community-based)

that connect herders directly to buyers, auction services, or cooperatives can
cut out exploitative middlemen. For example, aggregating and branding
pastoralist livestock or dairy could capture higher retail prices.
• Financial services: Tailored credit, savings and insurance products for mobile

herders – such as weather-index insurance or livestock investment accounts –
could stabilize incomes across drought cycles.
• Extension and animal health: Mobile veterinary teams or digital advisory

networks (text/voice services) to monitor herd health and give feeding/watering
guidance would boost productivity and reduce disease losses.
• Value addition: Processing of hides, milk (e.g. into cheese, butter or

powdered milk) and meat under hygienic conditions can add value locally.
Trust-building requires quality assurance – for instance, simple grading or
certification schemes that reassure buyers of pastoralist products.
• Resource management: Community‐driven water and feed projects (water

pans, fodder banks, pasture reseeding) can raise herd resilience. Renewable
energy (solar pumps, cold storage) could also help store milk and fresh meat
safely until sale.
